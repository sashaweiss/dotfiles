# Xcode-specific

## Keybindings

I have some editor keybinding customizations that I prefer, which are backed up here as a `.idekeybindings` file. The `sync-keybindings` script enables copying that keybindings file to and from the Xcode directory, since Xcode (as of Xcode 16.2) clobbers symlinks when saving an updated keybinding.

## Color theme

I use a custom editor theme, the contents of which are largely taken with appreciation from https://github.com/dmcrodrigues/Oceanic-Next-Xcode-Theme. (Note that it references my custom `Natasha II` font; see `/README.md`.)
