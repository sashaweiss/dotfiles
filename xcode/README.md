# Xcode-specific

This directory backs up Xcode configuration files, using the `sync-xcode-configs` script to copy them to/from the appropriate Xcode directories. (Manual copying is required since Xcode clobbers symlinks rather than writing to the pointed-to file whenever updates are made to the config via the GUI.)

Many thanks to https://github.com/dmcrodrigues/Oceanic-Next-Xcode-Theme for providing the foundation for my Xcode editor theme!
